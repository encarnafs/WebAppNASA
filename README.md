This project is a WebApi to play a little with NASA's public APIs.

I have chosen three options that I liked:

👉 - 𝗔𝗣𝗢𝗗: the astronomical image of the day (each day it is run will be different).

👉 - 𝗘𝗣𝗜𝗖: an image from the polychromatic cameras that captures several images of the Earth each day along with its information.

👉 - 𝗠𝗔𝗥𝗦 𝗥𝗢𝗩𝗘𝗥: an image of Mars taken by the Curiosity Rovers.
